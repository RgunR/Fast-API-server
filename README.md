# FastAPI Mental Health Chatbot

This project is a FastAPI server with two main parts: a chatbot that gives advice based on mental health prompts and a classification tool that sorts data into categories.

## Features

- **/rag Endpoint**: This is a chatbot that helps with mental health by finding relevant articles or blog posts based on what the user says. It uses a large language model to find and provide the right information.
- **/classification Endpoint**: This tool takes a dataset and sorts the data into different categories.

## Extra Features

- **Hugging Face Space**: Set up a Hugging Face Space to test and show how the models work.
- **Optimization**: Make sure the FastAPI application runs quickly and efficiently.
- **Productionization**: Use Docker to containerize and make the FastAPI server ready for production.
